The KinMS (KINematic Molecular Simulation) package can be used to simulate observations of arbitary molecular/atomic cold gas distributions. The routines are written with flexibility in mind, and have been used in various different applications, including investigating the kinematics of molecular gas in early-type galaxies (Davis et al, MNRAS, Volume 429, Issue 1, p.534-555, 2013), and determining supermassive black-hole masses from CO interfermetric observations (Davis et al., Nature, 2013). They are also useful for creating input datacubes for further simulation in e.g. CASA's sim_observe tool.
